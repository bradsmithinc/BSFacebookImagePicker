 @abstract   The BSFacebookImagePickerController class provides an interface for selecting photos from Facebook.
 @discussion The BSFacebookImagePickerController class manages all user interaction, including authenticaion.  The client 
             needs to set a Facebook App ID and Facebook App Secret.  These may be obtained from http://facebook.com/developers.  
             The provided delegate will be informed of the chosen photo, any possible failure, or the user's intent to cancel
             the operation.
